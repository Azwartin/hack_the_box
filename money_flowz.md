## Money Flowz
There was a name Frank Vitalik in the task, so I decided to find it and googled "Frank"+"Vitalik" and got second link on the page for [the reddit user](https://www.reddit.com/user/frankvitalik/). 

There were a link to ["freecoinz ethereum scam"](https://steemit.com/htb/@freecoinz/freecoinz) and an address at [the first post](https://www.reddit.com/user/frankvitalik/comments/goxefp/incredible_scam_giveaway_you_can_get_free_coins/).

The first and only comment tells about the ropsten net, so I went there and found [the wallet](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0x1b3247Cd0A59ac8B37A922804D150556dB837699). Well, If Frank got money from this wallet, I needed in [outgoing transactions](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/txs?a=0x1b3247Cd0A59ac8B37A922804D150556dB837699&f=2).
There was two tx, and each one had input data, which can be viewed in UTF-8 format and contained the flag.
